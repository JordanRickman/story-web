# StoryWeb

**Concept- and text-level writing for authors.**

StoryWeb in an application for authors, academics, game writers, and anyone who needs to write something long and complex.
StoryWeb provides tools for writing text, but its not about writing text. It's about writing *narratives*.

StoryWeb allows you to track *elements* of a narrative (such as characters, themes, events - 
any concept or object of significance in your work) and the *relationships* between them. It lets you map out the web
of connections that run through your story, with special support for things like timeline, cause-and-effect, and
relationships between characters. This information is linked to a collection of *artifacts*, which can be text
(chapters, scenes, sections, or any other potential snippet of the final work) or attachments (sketches, diagrams,
illustrations, spreadsheets - anything you can upload as a file). You can see where elements make an appearance in your
story, and comment on their role in the text. You can collect your text snippets in any order to export a document.

**Features**
* 100% Online - access your story anywhere there's a modern web browser
* Collaborative Editing
* Revision History and Version Control of text
     * eventually, versioning of elements and relationships as well
* Markdown support in text and meta-text (element and relationship descriptions).

**Who StoryWeb is for**
* Authors, particularly of long works like novels, (screen)plays, or serial fiction
* Academics, students, or anyone else doing long-form persuasive writing
* Game designers or writers of interactive fiction

**What StoryWeb is for**
* Planning the events of a story
* Mapping out the branching chain or web of possibilities in interactive fiction
* Developing a complex argument or a web of interrelated concepts
* Writing chapters, sections, scenes, or other sections of a larger work
* Drafting and revising
* Collaborating on text
* Communicating ideas with collaborators and maintaining an overview of the work

**What StoryWeb is not for**
* Formatting, page layout, or publishing. This is not the focus of StoryWeb, and
  its formatting features are limited to the rich text markup provided by Markdown.
  Write your content in StoryWeb, then export it into publishing tools to make it
  look pretty on the page or screen.
* Process management, task management, or other aspects of planning and coordinating a project
